The IoT Dumpster Fire 2020 Needs.

## How To Make
Files are incomplete. Will be adding STLs soon (need to tweak a few things).
Files needed to make the PCB (which isn't necessary) are included, recommend using the gerber files with Oshpark.

You will need:
* 6x3 array of WS2812 LEDs (neopixels) (you can use more/less, tweak the source).
* Bi-Directional Logic Level Converter (3.3v <-> 5v)

If not using PCB, a breadboard and a decent 5v power supply.

If using PCB, some headers and maybe a JST header.

You will need to do some fine solder work for the LEDs (and PCB if you use it).
